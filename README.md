# IntruderDectectionIT254
This project combines motion detection and facial recognition using Arduino and Google’s Teachable Machine. When motion is detected, the webcam checks the face. If recognized, it triggers a blue buzzer; if not, it sets off an alarm, shows “Intruder Alert,” and sends a text to a set phone number.
